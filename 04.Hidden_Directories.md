## **Hidden Files and Hidden Directories**

In Linux, hidden files and directories are those whose names begin with a dot (`.`). They are not displayed by default when listing files.

- To list all files (including hidden files), use:
  ```bash
  ls -a
  ```

### File System Navigation Commands

Every directory in Linux implicitly contains two special directories:
- `.` represents the current directory.
- `..` represents the parent directory.

**Navigation Commands:**

- `$ cd .`  
  Changes to the current directory (rarely used as it has no effect).

- `$ cd ..`  
  Changes to the parent directory.

- `$ cd`  
  Changes to the user's home directory (if no argument is passed).

- `$ cd ~`  
  The tilde `~` represents the user's home directory; this command changes to the home directory.

- `$ cd -`  
  Changes to the previous working directory.

**Example Commands:**
```bash
# Check current directory
pwd
# List all files, including hidden ones
ls -a
# Navigate up three levels
cd ../../..
# Return to the home directory
cd ~
# Return to the previous directory
cd -
```

**Sample Output:**
```plaintext
akshay@Ubuntu:~/Documents/DurgaSoft_Linux/tempdirectory$ pwd
/home/akshay/Documents/DurgaSoft_Linux/tempdirectory
akshay@Ubuntu:~/Documents/DurgaSoft_Linux/tempdirectory$ ls -a
.  ..
akshay@Ubuntu:~/Documents/DurgaSoft_Linux/tempdirectory$ cd ../../..
akshay@Ubuntu:~$ pwd
/home/akshay
```

## Linux File System Hierarchy

The Linux file system is organized as a tree-like structure, starting with the root directory (`/`). This root directory contains several important subdirectories, each serving a specific purpose:

1. **`/bin` Directory**  
   - Contains binary executables related to basic Linux commands.
   - Example commands: `ls`, `touch`, `mkdir`

   ```bash
   which touch  # Output: /usr/bin/touch
   which ls     # Output: /usr/bin/ls
   which mkdir  # Output: /usr/bin/mkdir
   ```

2. **`/sbin` Directory**  
   - Contains binary executables for system administration tasks, used primarily by the superuser (root).
   - Example tasks: Disk partitioning, network management.

   **Difference between `/bin` and `/sbin`:**
   - `/bin` is for commands accessible to all users.
   - `/sbin` is for commands used by the superuser.

3. **`/etc` Directory**  
   - Contains system configuration files that control the behavior of Linux.
   - Important files:
     - `/etc/passwd`: Contains user information.
     - `/etc/group`: Contains group information.
     - `/etc/hosts`: Contains IP and DNS mapping.

### Checking File Type

In Ubuntu, directories are often color-coded in blue, while other colors are used for different types of files. However, color conventions vary by distribution, so they are not a reliable method for checking file types.

To check the file type, use:
```bash
ls -l
```

**Output Example:**
```plaintext
-rw-rw-r-- 1 akshay akshay   342 Aug 29 07:52 directory-hierarchy-linux.mermaid
-rw-rw-r-- 1 akshay akshay   463 Aug 29 07:15 flow-example.mermaid
-rw-rw-r-- 1 akshay akshay    25 Aug 30 14:32 img.durga
```

The first character in the output indicates the file type:
- `d`: Directory
- `-`: Normal file
- `l`: Link file
- `c`: Character special file
- `b`: Block special file
- `s`: Socket file

**Note:** `c`, `b`, and `s` represent system files, which are primarily used by the superuser.
