## **Working with Directories in Linux**  

Managing directories efficiently is essential in Linux. The `mkdir` command helps create directories, while `touch` creates files. Wildcards (`{}`, `*`, `[]`) simplify bulk operations.

---

## **1. Creating Directories**  
The `mkdir` command is used to create directories.

### **Basic Usage**  
1. **Create a single directory**  
   ```sh
   mkdir project
   ```
2. **Create multiple directories at once**  
   ```sh
   mkdir reports logs backups
   ```
3. **Create a directory inside another existing directory**  
   ```sh
   mkdir project/docs
   ```
   *Note: `project` must exist before creating `docs` inside it.*
4. **Create a directory structure including parent directories**  
   ```sh
   mkdir -p project/docs/2024
   ```
   - `-p` ensures that all parent directories are created if they do not exist.

## **Case Study: IT Department File Organization**  
The IT department of a company needs a structured way to store **user logs, backups, and reports** for different years.

### **Required Structure**
```
IT_Department/
├── logs/
│   ├── 2022/
│   ├── 2023/
│   ├── 2024/
├── backups/
│   ├── weekly/
│   ├── monthly/
├── reports/
│   ├── q1/
│   ├── q2/
│   ├── q3/
│   ├── q4/
│   ├── annual/
```

### **Commands to Create This Structure**
```sh
# Create the main directory
mkdir IT_Department
cd IT_Department

# Create logs directories for different years
mkdir -p logs/{2022,2023,2024}

# Create backup directories
mkdir -p backups/{weekly,monthly}

# Create report directories for different quarters and annual reports
mkdir -p reports/{q1,q2,q3,q4,annual}
```

### **Verifying the Structure**
```sh
ls -R IT_Department
```
- `-R` lists all directories and subdirectories.  

---

## **2. Creating Files**  
The `touch` command is used to create empty files.

### **Basic Usage**
1. **Create a single file**  
   ```sh
   touch report.txt
   ```
2. **Create multiple files at once**  
   ```sh
   touch log1.txt log2.txt log3.txt
   ```
3. **Create files inside directories**  
   ```sh
   touch logs/2024/system.log
   ```

### **Case Study: Automating Log File Creation**  
The IT team wants **30 daily log files for each month in 2024**.

#### **Command to Create Daily Logs**
```sh
touch logs/2024/daily_log_{1..30}.txt
```
- This creates `daily_log_1.txt` to `daily_log_30.txt` inside `logs/2024/`.

#### **Verifying the Created Files**
```sh
ls logs/2024/
```

## **3. Using Wildcards in Directory and File Management**
Wildcards help perform bulk operations.

| Wildcard | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| `{}` | Expands multiple values | `mkdir {HR,Finance,IT}` |
| `*` | Matches any number of characters | `ls *.txt` (Lists all `.txt` files) |
| `?` | Matches a single character | `rm log?.txt` (Deletes `log1.txt`, `log2.txt`, etc.) |
| `[]` | Matches a range of characters | `ls file[1-3].txt` (Lists `file1.txt`, `file2.txt`, `file3.txt`) |

---

## **4. Removing Directories and Files**
1. **Remove an empty directory**  
   ```sh
   rmdir backups/weekly
   ```
2. **Remove a directory and its contents**  
   ```sh
   rm -r IT_Department
   ```
3. **Remove files**  
   ```sh
   rm logs/2024/daily_log_*.txt
   ```

## **Case Study: University Data Management System**  

A university IT department needs to organize its data storage system for **students, faculty, and administrative records**. They want a structured system with logs, reports, and backups while ensuring efficient file management.

---

## **Objective**  
1. **Create directories** for each department (Students, Faculty, Administration).  
2. **Create subdirectories** for different types of files (Attendance, Marks, Salaries, Reports).  
3. **Generate daily log files automatically** for attendance and administration.  
4. **Use wildcards** to manage files efficiently.  
5. **Delete old log files** and directories when needed.  

---

## **Required Structure**
```
University_Data/
├── Students/
│   ├── Attendance/
│   ├── Marks/
│   ├── Reports/
├── Faculty/
│   ├── Salaries/
│   ├── Reports/
├── Administration/
│   ├── Budgets/
│   ├── Reports/
│   ├── Logs/
├── Backups/
│   ├── Daily/
│   ├── Monthly/
```

---

## **Commands to Create This Structure**  
### **Step 1: Create Main Directory and Subdirectories**
```sh
mkdir University_Data
cd University_Data

# Create department directories
mkdir Students Faculty Administration Backups

# Create subdirectories
mkdir -p Students/{Attendance,Marks,Reports}
mkdir -p Faculty/{Salaries,Reports}
mkdir -p Administration/{Budgets,Reports,Logs}
mkdir -p Backups/{Daily,Monthly}
```

### **Verify the Structure**
```sh
ls -R University_Data
```
- `-R` lists all directories and subdirectories.

---

## **Step 2: Creating Log and Report Files**
### **Create Monthly Attendance Logs (For Students)**
```sh
touch Students/Attendance/attendance_{jan,feb,mar,apr,may,jun,jul,aug,sep,oct,nov,dec}_2024.txt
```

### **Create Daily Logs for Administration**
```sh
touch Administration/Logs/admin_log_{1..30}.txt
```

### **Create Faculty Salary Reports**
```sh
touch Faculty/Salaries/salary_{jan,feb,mar,apr,may,jun,jul,aug,sep,oct,nov,dec}_2024.txt
```

### **Verify Created Files**
```sh
ls Students/Attendance/
ls Administration/Logs/
```

---

## **Step 3: Using Wildcards for Bulk Operations**
### **List All Text Files in Any Directory**
```sh
ls University_Data/**/*.txt
```
- `**` searches in subdirectories.  

### **Copy All Reports to a Backup Directory**
```sh
cp -r {Students,Faculty,Administration}/Reports Backups/Monthly/
```

### **Move Old Logs to Backup**
```sh
mv Administration/Logs/admin_log_{1..15}.txt Backups/Daily/
```

### **Delete Specific Log Files**
```sh
rm Administration/Logs/admin_log_*.txt
```

---

## **Step 4: Removing Directories and Files**
### **Remove an Empty Directory**
```sh
rmdir Backups/Daily
```

### **Remove a Directory with Contents**
```sh
rm -r University_Data
```

---

## **Final Verification**
```sh
ls -R University_Data
```
- Ensures everything is organized correctly.

## Case Study 3: Directory Structure Example

### Directory Structure:

```
/
└── home
    └── akshay
        ├── X
        │   ├── X1
        │   │   ├── X11
        │   │   └── X12
        │   └── X2
        └── Y
            ├── Y1
            │   ├── Y11
            │   └── Y12
            └── Y2
```

### Steps:

1. Create the `x` directory and its subdirectories:
   ```bash
   mkdir x
   cd x
   mkdir x1 x2
   cd x1
   mkdir x11 x12
   ```

2. To create nested directories:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p x/x1/x1{1,2}
   mkdir -p y/y1/y1{1,2}
   ```

### Displaying Tree Structure:

```bash
akshay@Ubuntu:~$ tree /F x
/F  [error opening dir]
x
└── x1
    ├── x11
    └── x12

3 directories, 0 files

akshay@Ubuntu:~$ tree /F y
/F  [error opening dir]
y
└── y1
    ├── y11
    └── y12

3 directories, 0 files
```

## Case Study 4: Creating Directories with Files

### Create 5 directories (`dir6`, `dir7`, `dir8`, `dir9`, `dir10`), and in each directory, create files `a.txt`, `b.txt`, `c.txt`, and `d.txt`:

1. To create the directories:
   ```bash
   mkdir dir{6..10}
   ```

2. To create the files:
   ```bash
   touch dir{6..10}/{a..d}.txt
   ```

**Note**: `*`, `[]`, `{}` are called wildcard characters, which can be used in many commands.
