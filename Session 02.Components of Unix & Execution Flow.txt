1. Components of UNIX:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    
    2 Important Components:

        a. Shell
        b. Kernal

a. shell:
~~~~~~~~~
> It is outer layer of unix operating system.
> Shell reads command whether it is valid command or not.
> Shell reads command whether it is properly used or not.
> If everyting is proper then shell interpreats/converts than ccommand into kernal understandable form and handover that to kernal.
> Shell act as interface between user and kernal.

b. Kernal:
~~~~~~~~~~
> It is the core component of unix operating system.
> It is responsible to execute our command with help of hardware components.
> Memory allocation and process allocation is take care by kernal.
> It act as interface between shell and hardware components.

To do a big task we may requires multiple commands:

>> gedit test.sh 
>> chmod u+x test.sh 
execute this commands
>> ./test.sh

Types of users in Linux system:

Normal user                     :   $ prompt
Super user/Root user/Admin user :   # prompt

akshay@Ubuntu:~/Documents/DurgaSoft_Linux$ sudo -i
root@Ubuntu:~# whoami
root
root@Ubuntu:~# exit
logout
akshay@Ubuntu:~/Documents/DurgaSoft_Linux$ 
~~~~~~~

sudo -i   :  switch to superuser
