_______________
/dev Directory:


"dev" stands for "device"
In Linux, everything is treated as a file, including devices
Every device is represented as a file
These files are used to communicate with devices
All device-related files are stored inside the /dev directory

tty: Terminal-related file
fd: Floppy drive-related file
hd: Hard disk-related file
ram: RAM-related file
stdin: Standard input device file (keyboard)
stdout: Standard output device file (terminal/monitor)
stderr: Standard error device file (terminal/monitor)


_______________
/mnt Directory:

"mnt" stands for "mounting"
Used for attaching external file systems to the Linux file system
External sources include:
Pen drives
CDs
External hard disks
Mounting is the process of attaching these external file systems
In older operating systems, mounting had to be performed manually
Recent operating systems generally perform mounting automatically
Files related to manual mounting are placed inside the /mnt directory


7.
_______________
/media Directory:

Used for automatically mounted devices
Files from automatically mounted devices are placed here
Common examples include:

USB drives
External hard drives
CD/DVD drives

Part of the more modern Linux directory structure
Helps separate automatically mounted devices from manually mounted ones (/mnt)


_______________
Difference between /mnt and /media:

/mnt directory:
- Contains manually mounted files
- Used for temporary mounts by system administrators

/media directory:
- Contains automatically mounted files
- Used for removable media automatically mounted by the system


_______________
/opt Directory:

"opt" stands for "optional"
Contains installation files for third-party software
Used for software not included in the default system installation
Examples of software typically installed here:

Google Chrome
Oracle products
Other manually installed applications


Helps keep third-party applications separate from system files
Allows for easier management of non-standard software


_______________
 lib Directory:

The lib directory stands for "library" and contains essential shared libraries and kernel modules required by the Linux OS, commands, and applications.


_______________ 
var Directory:

var stands for "variable data." It stores data that changes frequently, such as system logs, mail, print spools, and temporary files.
Log files are a common example of data stored within the var directory.

_______________
home Directory:

Linux is a multi-user operating system, and each user has a separate directory under home to store their personal files like videos, images, and documents.
The home directory contains subdirectories for each user. For example, /home/durgasoft is the home directory for the user "durgasoft" and includes folders like Desktop, Downloads, Movies, and Pictures.

_______________
proc Directory:

proc stands for "processes."
It contains information about all currently running processes in the system. Each process is represented by a directory named after its Process ID (PID), which stores related process data.

Note: We can find all running proceses information by using ps command. ps means process status. 

Here's the information about the root directory presented in a format similar to the previous responses:

_______________
root Directory:

It is the home directory of the super user (also known as root user)
Located at /root in the filesystem hierarchy
Not to be confused with the / (root) directory of the entire filesystem

Note:
/home/durgasoft is the Durgasoft User Home Directory
/root is the Super User Home Directory

_______________
root Directory: 
It is the home directory of super user.  

Note: 
/home/durgasoft - Durgasoft User Home Directory 
/root - Super User Home Directory


Q3 What is the difference between / and Root Directories? 
/ acts as root for Linux file system. It is the topmost directory of linux file system. root is subdirectory of /, which acts as home directory for the super user. 

ps command:

"ps command===>process status"
This indicates that the 'ps' command is used to display the status of processes.

Example usage:

The command shown is "$ ps -ef"
This specific option combination (-ef) typically shows all processes in full format.

/proc directory:

The image explains: "For every process a separate directory will be created inside proc directory to maintain that process specific information.."
This means that the /proc directory in Linux contains subdirectories, each corresponding to a running process.
These subdirectories store information specific to their respective processes.

boot Directory:

Contains files required to boot the Linux operating system
Typically includes the kernel, initial RAM disk, and bootloader configuration


usr Directory:

"usr" stands for user
Contains all user-related software
Major subdirectories typically include:

/usr/bin: User commands
/usr/sbin: System administration commands
/usr/lib: Libraries
/usr/share: Architecture-independent data

Note: It's worth mentioning that while "usr" is often thought to stand for "user", it historically stood for "Unix System Resources". However, the interpretation as "user" is widely accepted in modern usage.
Additional Notes on Linux File System:

Advantage:
The main advantage of the Linux File System is that the operating system can locate required files very easily.

File System Naming:
Each File System is assigned a separate name.

Linux File System Names:
Examples include ext2, ext3, ext4, XFS

Windows File System Names:
Examples include NTFS, FAT
