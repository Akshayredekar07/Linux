If you want to uninstall a package on a Debian-based Linux distribution (like Ubuntu), you can use the `apt` package manager. Here’s how to uninstall it:

### Basic Uninstallation

To remove a package but keep its configuration files (in case you want to reinstall it later), use:

```bash
sudo apt remove <package_name>
```

Replace `<package_name>` with the name of the package you want to uninstall. For example, to uninstall `wimtools`, you’d use:

```bash
sudo apt remove wimtools
```

### Complete Uninstallation (Including Configuration Files)

If you want to completely remove the package and all its associated configuration files, use:

```bash
sudo apt purge <package_name>
```

For example:

```bash
sudo apt purge wimtools
```

### Removing Unused Dependencies

After uninstalling a package, you may have dependencies that are no longer needed. To clean them up, run:

```bash
sudo apt autoremove
```

### Verifying Uninstallation

You can confirm that the package is no longer installed by running:

```bash
dpkg -l | grep <package_name>
```

This will list all packages with that name. If it doesn’t return anything, the package has been successfully removed.
