Regular expressions (regex) are a powerful tool for pattern matching in text. Here's a more structured explanation of the patterns you provided:

---

### **1. Character Patterns**
These patterns match specific character arrangements in text.

1. **Example 1: `grep 'd*' demo.txt`**
   - Matches lines with zero or more occurrences of the character `d` followed by any number of characters.
   - Note: In most regex implementations, `d*` matches *zero* or more `d`s, which may include lines without `d`. Ubuntu's `grep` may not support this syntax.

2. **Example 2: `grep 'c[aeiou]ll' demo.txt`**
   - Matches any word starting with `c`, followed by a vowel (`a, e, i, o, u`), and ending with `ll`.
   - Examples: `call`, `cell`, `cill`, `coll`, `cull`.

3. **Example 3: `grep 'b..l' demo.txt`**
   - Matches words where:
     - The first character is `b`,
     - Followed by any two characters (indicated by `..`),
     - Ending with `l`.
   - Example matches: `ball`, `bill`, `bell`.

### **2. Word Patterns**
These patterns focus on matching entire words or specific positions in words.

#### Special Syntax:
- `\<word\>`: Matches the exact word `word`.
- `\<xyz`: Matches words that *start* with `xyz`.
- `xyz\>`: Matches words that *end* with `xyz`.

#### Examples:

1. **Basic Example: `grep 'durga' demo.txt`**
   - Matches any line containing the sequence `durga`.
   - Example matches: `durga`, `durgasoft`, `techdurga`.

2. **Exact Word Match: `grep '\<durga\>' demo.txt`**
   - Matches the exact word `durga`.
   - Example matches: `durga` (but not `durgasoft` or `techdurga`).

3. **Starts with `durga`: `grep '\<durga' demo.txt`**
   - Matches words that start with `durga`.
   - Example matches: `durga`, `durgasoft`.

4. **Ends with `durga`: `grep 'durga\>' demo.txt`**
   - Matches words that end with `durga`.
   - Example matches: `durga`, `techdurga`.

---

### **3. Line Patterns**
These patterns match specific patterns within entire lines.

1. **Example: `grep '\<[0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9]\>' demo.txt`**
   - Matches lines containing exactly 4-digit numbers.
   - Example matches: `1234`, `6789`.

---

### **Practical Usage:**
The examples provided are applicable in contexts where `grep` is used to search text files for patterns. 

### Additional Notes:
- Ubuntu users should ensure they are using `grep` with appropriate flags (e.g., `-E` for extended regex if required).
- Misuse of special characters or the need for escaping (`\`) depends on the shell environment and version of `grep`.
