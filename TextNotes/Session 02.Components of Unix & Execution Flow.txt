    2 Important Components:

        a. Shell
        b. Kernal

a. shell:
~~~~~~~~~
> It is the outer layer of the UNIX operating system.
> Shell reads command whether it is valid command or not.
> Shell reads command whether it is properly used or not.
> If everything is correct, the shell interprets the command into a kernel-understandable form and hands it over to the kernel.
> Shell act as interface between user and the kernal.



b. Kernal:
~~~~~~~~~~
> It is the core component of UNIX operating system.
> It is responsible for executing commands with the help of hardware components.
> Memory allocation and process allocation are managed by the kernel.
> It acts as an interface between the shell and hardware components.

To do a big task we may requires multiple commands:

Create a new shell script file using the command:
>> gedit test.sh  
Make the shell script executable with the command:
>> chmod u+x test.sh  
Execute the shell script using the command:
>> ./test.sh 

Types of users in Linux system:

Normal user                     :   $ prompt
Super user/Root user/Admin user :   # prompt

~~~~~~~
akshay@Ubuntu:~/Documents/DurgaSoft_Linux$ whoami
akshay
akshay@Ubuntu:~/Documents/DurgaSoft_Linux$ sudo -i
root@Ubuntu:~# whoami
root
root@Ubuntu:~# exit
logout
akshay@Ubuntu:~/Documents/DurgaSoft_Linux$ 
~~~~~~~

sudo -i   :  switch to superuser
exit      :  retrun back to normal user
